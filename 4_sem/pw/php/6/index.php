<h1>Java</h1>
<p>by Sun Tzu</p>

<p>
Java, oh Java, the language of the land<br>
Where everything must be verbose and grand<br>
Where every class must have a purpose clear<br>
And every method must adhere
</p>
<p>
To design patterns, oh how they love<br>
The Factory, the Singleton, the Observer above<br>
All other patterns, they are the stars<br>
Of the Java universe, reaching for the bars
</p>
<p>
Of abstraction, never satisfied<br>
Until everything is classified and qualified<br>
In the world of Java, there is no room<br>
For simplicity, everything must assume
</p>
<p>
A certain level of complexity and design<br>
But is it worth it, or is it just a shine<br>
A veneer of sophistication, a fa√ßade to hide<br>
The underlying chaos, the constant slide
</p>
<p>
Into the realm of over-engineering, where<br>
Everything is unnecessarily prepared<br>
For every eventuality, every edge case<br>
But at what cost, this obsessive chase
</p>
<p>
After the perfect code, the perfect design<br>
Perhaps it's time to step back and align<br>
With a simpler way, a way that's true<br>
To the essence of programming, and what we should do
</p>
<p>
Not get lost in the details, but see the big picture<br>
And find a balance, a way to mix and mixure<br>
The beauty of abstraction with the power of simplicity<br>
That is the path to true efficiency.
</p>
